# Healthcare Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is a **Healthcare Data Analysis** initiative aimed at deriving meaningful insights from a raw dataset obtained from Kaggle: [Healthcare Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset). The dataset consists of patient demographics, medical conditions, billing details, insurance information, and treatment history.

The analysis follows a structured data workflow:
1. **Data Cleaning & Formatting** (Excel)
2. **Data Analysis & Query Execution** (MySQL)
3. **Data Visualization & Dashboard Creation** (Power BI)

## Data Source
- **Dataset Name**: Healthcare Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset)

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: Data cleaning, formatting, pivot table creation, and dashboard visualization.
- **MySQL**: Query execution for deep insights and structured data retrieval.
- **Power BI**: Powerful and engaging data visualization and dashboard creation.

## Data Processing Steps
### 1. Data Cleaning & Formatting (Excel)
- Removed duplicate records and handled missing values.
- Standardized column names and data formats.
- Created **Pivot Tables** and **Excel Dashboards** to visualize basic insights.

### 2. Data Analysis Using SQL (MySQL)
Performed deep data analysis by solving the following queries:

#### **Demographics**
1. **Patient Distribution:**
   - What is the distribution of patients by gender, age group, or blood type?
   - How many patients belong to each medical condition?

2. **Insurance Insights:**
   - Which insurance providers cover the most patients?
   - What is the average billing amount per insurance provider?

#### **Financial Analysis**
3. **Billing Insights:**
   - What is the average billing amount by medical condition, hospital, or doctor?
   - Identify the top 10 highest billing cases and their details.

4. **Treatment Costs:**
   - Is there a correlation between admission type (emergency vs. elective) and billing amounts?
   - What is the proportion of free treatments vs. paid treatments?

#### **Medical Insights**
5. **Condition and Treatment Analysis:**
   - Which medical conditions have the longest average stay duration?
   - Are there trends in test results (normal vs. abnormal) for specific conditions?

6. **Doctor Performance:**
   - Which doctors handle the most patients?
   - Are there significant differences in treatment outcomes among doctors?

#### **Temporal Trends**
7. **Time-Based Trends:**
   - What are the admission trends over time (e.g., by month or year)?
   - Are there seasonal trends in medical conditions or treatments?

### 3. Data Visualization in Power BI
- Created an **interactive and dynamic Power BI Dashboard** to visualize key insights from the dataset.
- Incorporated charts, graphs, and KPIs for a **powerful and engaging representation** of findings.
- Filtered data by medical conditions, billing insights, patient demographics, and more.
